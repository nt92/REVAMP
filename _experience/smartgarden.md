SmartGarden is a monitoring system that uses IoT technology such as moisture sensors, sunlight detectors, and proximity sensors to automatically monitor activity in gardens and provide valuable insights to the gardener. This was a project created for [MistMakers](http://www.mist-center.org/mist-makers-2-0-at-university-of-florida/), a part of the EE department at UF dedicated to creating solutions utilizing IoT technology.

I found the project interesting and had a little bit of free time after finals so I asked my friend who was heading the project if he needed any help. They ended up needing a few mobile developers so I offered to build the Android app, which involved being able to update the configurations on the IoT sensors, be able to connect with the other applications (webapp & iOS app) through a Heroku Server, and visualize the insights given by the sensors.

### Learning Areas
* Android development
* Low level networking requests
* IoT device integration
* Debugging a Heroku Server
* Data visualization on Android

### Status
Current being worked on by MistMakers. Someone else has taken over the development of the Android Application. The project will be demoed during Spring 2018.
