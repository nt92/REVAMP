The iOS and Android apps for SwampHacks included a set of hacker features: QR scanner, calendar, announcements, profile, and a set of organizer features: scanning in hackers, ability to add announcements, counting members in attendance at events, and overall served to provide a platform for organizers to interact with hackers and organize logistics in a simple way. 

### Trip to India
Prior to the winter holidays before SwampHacks 2017, two things seemed certain. One, I would be spending my break with family in India, and two, our Android Developer would finish the app over the break. Only one of those ended up happening. Our Android Developer ended up receiving a job offer he could not refuse at the last minute and ended up not having time to do so. As Director of Technology, it then fell on me to make sure the app got finished in time.

Just thinking about it now stresses me out.

Thankfully my trip to India involved a lot of passive travel and I was able to get in the flow and get a lot done during these trips. One moment of realization occurred to me when we were traveling 8 hours by car to a Tirupati, a pilgrimage area. I was working on the login page and I looked outside and saw monkeys running into the sunset. Needless to say I closed my laptop and spent the rest of the weekend actually enjoying the experience I was having. Over the next few weeks though, I got the hold of Android development and it was just a matter of putting a few hours each day to get it done.
