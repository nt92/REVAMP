### *Won HackIllinois 2016 Solstice Mobile's Best Use of Emerging Tech to Make an Impact Hack*

FlushLess is an attachable device using Particle Spark Core and proximity sensor to convert urinal sensors into smart sensors which records amount of time urinal used and time elapsed to calculate optimal time to flush urinal and reduces 70-90% of water usage, estimating 32,000 gallons saved per urinal annually.
