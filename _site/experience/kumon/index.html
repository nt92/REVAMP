				<h1 id="my-first-job">My first job!</h1>
<p>Before starting my senior year of high school, I decided that I wanted to begin working and begin getting my own stream of income to pay for things myself. Eventually after much job searching and convincing my parents that I wasn’t going to fall apart from the stress of working a part-time job and still dealing with school, I was able to procure a job at Kumon tutoring center as a math tutor.</p>

<h3 id="initial-impressions">Initial Impressions</h3>
<p>I’m not sure what I really expected, but my first impression was that this was stressful! For three days a week, from 3pm - 8pm I was to have myself mentally immersed in the complex act of inspiring a love for math in twenty different kids simultaneously, all with differing temperaments and math backgrounds. Needless to say, it was very exhausting for a few weeks and I contemplated quitting as my coursework and responsibilities with band and tennis begun picking up. However, I decided that since I made a promise to myself that I would see it through til the end of the semester I would suck it up and continue working. I am glad that I did, because it ended up getting a lot easier as I learned the different learning styles of my students and how to automate/parallelize some processes, such as having two kids work on the same problemset and proofread each other’s work to promote collaboration and repetition (the main mantras of Kumon).</p>

<h3 id="what-i-learned">What I learned</h3>
<p>My biggest takeaway from this experience is a much greater appreciation and respect for those in the teaching professions, as it is as mentally taxing as it is rewarding. I also gained a lot of perspective for the learning styles of different students. I spent the first few years of my primary schooling in India, which is <em>very heavy</em> on repetition to the point where I knew all of my multiplication tables by heart up to 20 by the time I was six years old! I realize that this was a huge advantage for me in my early years and even now, and take it for granted that many students do not have that experience here in America.</p>
