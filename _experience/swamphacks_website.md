This is the website for SwampHacks 2017, The University of Florida's premier hackathon. I worked on it with two other developers as the director of technology, and over the course of four months we fleshed out a full stack website with infrastructure to handle over 500 simultaneous users. This was my first real foray into creating a very attractive user interface, and spent many hours implementing the parallax library and CSS animations that allows you visually see all of the animals represented in the swamp.

### Learning Areas
* Front end development
* Using a BaaS (Firebase)
* Javascript, lots of Javascript
