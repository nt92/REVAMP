				<p>ScreenTime is an online video conferencing platform that fills the gap of lack of one-on-one interaction between online personalities (like Youtubers, gamers, musicians), and their followers. Today, no widely-known platform exists which allows for this easy one-on-one connection and ScreenTime makes this interaction accessible AND useful for both parties. The first group is the users who get easy access to have a conversation with their favorite personalities for a fixed cost. The second group is the content creators who get the benefit of being able to have engagement with their fanbase and gain a supplemental income, all while doing it on THEIR schedule.</p>

<p>This was a project for Engineering Entrepreneurship and was a lot different for me as it was my first course in college that had the grade solely be on a <em>non-technical</em> project. Instead of creating a product or application, our team had to create a business plan that would convince investors to give us ‘money’ to further develop our product. Links to some of our presentations which explain the concept and how we tried to market to investors can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXWEpElHY7U">here</a> for our Value Proposition and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J2aQq7Bux4">here</a> for our Business Model Canvas.</p>

<p>I had the idea for time-blocked conversation a while ago and had it written down in my notebook, and while pitching ideas to the class my team found an affinity to it, so we honed in on our target audience (online personalities and their fans) and ran with it. I was the CEO for our company and REALLY stretched my comfort zone as I explored skills such as leading a group of people with a unified vision, interfacing between investors and the team, as well as the pressure involved in trying to keep a company afloat.</p>
