# The Teacher *and* The Student
In our fourth semester in college, [CodePath](https://codepath.org/) started their university program, with UF included in their pilot schools. The course was in iOS development. My roommate Takashi and I were interested, but we were late to enrollâ€”as students. So with no knowledge of iOS development, we signed up as the only two student teachers and went on to lead a course of 24 students in how to develop in iOS.

For the group project, my team built Vente. Vente is an application that allows for people to find those with similar interests by having crowdsourced events in the area. We spent over 6 weeks building this app, and because it was something that I was building on my own terms, it was the first time that I felt truly passionate about a project and was excited to wake up and work on it.

The process of teaching involved working directly with CodePath's creators in which we would have weekly Google Hangouts to interface for any questions that we may have, how to present the lecture, and common concerns students may have, and then teach the class twice a week for two hour blocks, utilizing the same content we had just learned. We continued this for 12 weeks and by the end, all of the students were proficient in iOS development and UF ended up receiving the highest approval rating of all of CodePath's pilot schools.

### Learning Areas
* iOS development
* Teaching a class
* Logistic planning

### Status
Vente is no longer being worked on, but the legacy of CodePath lives on within UF and other schools. In the semesters following the first iteration, there has been another iOS course, a web security course sponsored by Facebook, and an interview prep course, all with favorable ratings from students and CodePath.
