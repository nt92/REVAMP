# A Unique and Unexpected Experience

### Indiegogo
Sadly, the best way to relay to someone what Indiegogo is, is to compare it to it's main competitor: Kickstarter. Or as our marketing team likes to put it: *'The older, better, and more feature-rich Kickstarter you haven't heard of*. In a nutshell, Indiegogo was the company that pioneered crowdfunding and was built on the idea of entrepreneurship from the grassroots level, encouraging creators to create and providing the platform and resources to do so, whether it be logistical help, a marketplace, or advice from experts regarding marketing or branding.

Indiegogo was an amazing place with amazing people with a mission that I truly felt drawn to and felt that the company aligned with. From the puppies to the coworkers who all had that entrepreneurial spirit and creative flare, I was truly excited to come to work every day.

### What I Made
As I first joined the team a lot of the work was being devoted to changing some of the existing codebase to be in a new framework (Angular.js to Vue.js) so a good amount of my initial work was centered around this in order to give me more exposure to a more modern framework like Vue and I worked on projects such as analytics for the campaigner pre-launch page, the possibility of a survey perk for campaigners, and also spent a bit of time building out the Vue app for rewriting the site header, including the routing, front end, design, etc.

Towards the end of the internship I got my *'intern project'* which was to revamp the referral experience that currently existed. Basically this meant to create a more detailed display of data for the campaigners, as well as a more granular CSV download with information of ALL of the different referral programs. Finally, this project involved creating a small modal for dynamically generating referral programs. I enjoyed working on this project as a whole, mainly because I was able to get comfortable with Vue.js and Rails from the past stuff I worked on.

### Learning Areas
* Full-stack web is fun! (with Vue.js)
* Stronger understanding of system architecture
* The value of a good mentor (s/o to [Mike](https://www.youtube.com/user/manualistmike))
* I had a sobering realization of the nature of what startup life can be
* Even so, I want to work in San Francisco full-time @ a startup
