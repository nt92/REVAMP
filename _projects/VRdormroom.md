Imagine being a bright-eyed 18 year old leaving the house for the first time to attend college. One of the biggest transitions for future college students is that of living on your own, typically in a dorm. The current method of viewing living options is very limited and doesn't truly provide any insight into what the student would actually enjoy living in.

Dorm VRoom was a solution to this problem by providing VR models of various dorm rooms for students to view utilizing cutting edge 3D modeling technology through a partnership with a local Gainesville startup [Paracosm](https://paracosm.io/), and the University of Florida Housing Department.

### Learning Areas
* Development in Unity
* Leading a development team
* Creation of introductory workshops
* Idea facilitation

### Status
This project is *no longer being developed*. Dorm VRoom did serve as inspiration for future VR development at the University of Florida as members of the team were involved in the process of the university getting a grant from [Crytek](http://www.crytek.com/news/vr-first-program-attracts-backing-from-technology-leaders) to further VR development at UF. This led to a large growth of interest from students and development in VR was more accessible. Currently, there's a class at UF dedicated purely to the development of VR technology for [Social Good](https://vrforthesocialgood.wordpress.com/).
